# Getting Started

Requires [make]() and a C compiler (such as [gcc]()).

1. Clone this repository, e.g. using the GitHub CLI: `$ gh repo clone CFiggers/kiko`

2. Change directories into the cloned repo: `$ cd kiko`

3. Run make: `$ make`

Result => A binary named `kiko` in the project root.

Run kiko: `$ kiko`

To run anywhere, put kiko on your $PATH (such as by creating a symlink into a `bin` folder in your home directory).
